# Multi-Agent-Decision-Systems-Using-Python\
This project is a comprehensive implementation of multiple Artificial Intelligence agents and search strategies using Python. It includes five distinct modules, each showcasing a different type of intelligent agent or algorithm. The first module is a simple reflex agent that performs medical diagnosis based on user symptoms and test reports, suggesting appropriate treatments for conditions like pneumonia, tonsillitis, and appendicitis. The second module features a model-based agent for navigating the Wumpus World, designed to locate gold while avoiding hidden dangers using perceptual updates and logical reasoning. The third module implements a goal-based/utility-based agent to play a simplified Pacman game, focusing on food collection, power pellet consumption, and ghost avoidance. The fourth module simulates a room service robot using DFS and IDDFS to serve multiple rooms efficiently with cost minimization. Lastly, a Uniform Cost Search (UCS) algorithm is used to solve the classic bridge-crossing problem, determining the optimal path and minimum time required. The project emphasizes AI reasoning, decision-making, pathfinding, and user interaction in a variety of simulated environments.
